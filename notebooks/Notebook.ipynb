    "In the modern day of increasing adoption of technology, Hotels need to keep up with modern technology to compete and stay in business. One thing that every hotel needs to be aware of is the OTA, or Online Travel Agency, which is a third-party website or platform that allows travelers to book accommodations, flights, car rentals, and other travel services online. These platforms act as intermediaries, connecting hotels with potential guests and offering a convenient way to search, compare, and book travel arrangements. Using these comes with it's own problems. Some common Modern Hotel Problems include: =\n",

    "Digital Convenience:\n",
    "Guests want easy online booking, mobile check-in/check-out, and access to information via apps or websites. \n",
    "Relevant columns: Booking changes, Deposit type, Customer Type \n",
    "\n",
    "Competition:\n",
    "The hospitality industry is highly competitive, requiring hotels to differentiate themselves and manage pricing effectively. \n",
    "Relevant columns: previous cancellations, market segment, booking changes, days in waiting list, customer type \n",
